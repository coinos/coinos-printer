# ArduinoHDLC
HDLC library for arduino

This Project is based on https://github.com/jarkko-hautakorpi/Arduhdlc .  
I changed some function name, make code more clean and added one example.  
The example is mainly tested on ESP8266 Arduino 2.3.0 environment.  
A portable pure C version can be found here: https://github.com/mengguang/minihdlc
